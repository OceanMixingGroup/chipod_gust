This is the proposed order to execute the m-file routines

1) create_header
2) pre_driver[ do_vel_m ] (only if you have available velocity data)
3) calibrate_pitot
4) pre_driver[ do_vel_p ]  
5) pre_driver[ do_temp ]   (Not really necessary, but potentially useful)
6) pre_driver[ do_dTdz_m ]  (if you have available mooring stratification)
7) pre_driver[ do_dTdz_i ]  (only if you have a surface pumped mooring)

8) main_driver
