This is the proposed order to execute the m-file routines

1) create_header
2) pre_driver[ do_vel_m ]  (only if you have available velocity data)
3) calibrate_pitot                                                         [1y in  5 min on MS]
4) pre_driver[ do_vel_p ]  
5) pre_driver[ do_temp ]   (Not really necessary, but potentially useful)  [1y in  30 min on MS]
6) pre_driver[ do_dTdz_m ] (if you have available mooring stratification)
7) pre_driver[ do_dTdz_i ] (only if you have a surface pumped mooring)     [1y in  30 min on MS]

8) main_driver             [1y in 2h/HFset and 30min/ICset on MS]
